Anticipating these instabilities before they occur and applying preventive strategies to avoid them can have important positive effect such as prioritizing citizen safety, stabilizing social structure, minimizing economic damage, issuance of travel warnings for the tourism industry, and insight into how citizens express themselves in situations like these.

The reasons that lead to a civil unrest can be of various types. They can be motivated by political or economic instability, or the result of peopleâ€™s anger, frustration or upset. In many countries, social unrest incidents can display ethnic differences, which in many cases are the direct result from social and economic imbalances between social groups.

This study tries to build a framework in order to anticipate the number of social unrest events in Tamil Nadu (only one state) as well as India (whole country) using spatial models. 
Several predictor variables that denote the socio-demographic, economic and climatology components of the study region such as literacy rate, urbanicity, 
population composition based on caste, GDP, Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), and crop productivity are used as predictor variables. Note that the study region India is chosed due to its ethnic diversity, large number of protests during the study period, and availability of the data.
